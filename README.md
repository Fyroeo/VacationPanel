PHP/HTML/Bootstrap full web app made at NETLOR SAS (as a trainee) in 2015. Free of content from this enterprise.

**Note: this project includes some piece of code from the Internet, and some libraries. I'm searching for their license files so that I can include them to my GitHub. For more transparency, I will do one commit of the "as-is" project, and one commit where I add all of these license things. All of the licenses are GPL3-compatible, I checked.**
